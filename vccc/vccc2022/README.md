# vccc2022

My (non submitted) entry for the [Vintage Computing Christmas Challenge 2022](https://logiker.com/Vintage-Computing-Christmas-Challenge-2022). I didn't submit this because to me this was more a personal challenge than a competition. I am quite happy with my results.

I coded an initial naive version (114 bytes) and then set my goal to getting something shorter than 100 bytes. After 5 more versions I ended with a 70 bytes .com file. Not that bad for this dinocoder! ;)

Just after watching the [VCCC 2022 Results video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVKEaRogw-s) I felt like I could save some more bytes by refactoring my last version (v6) to draw triangles instead of quadrilaterals and that is how I got to [my final 50 bytes version](v7.asm).

| version | executable size |
| :-: | --: |
| [v1](v1.asm) | 114 bytes |
| [v2](v2.asm) | 111 bytes |
| [v3](v3.asm) | 100 bytes |
| [v4](v4.asm) | 97 bytes |
| [v5](v5.asm) | 83 bytes |
| [v6](v6.asm) | 70 bytes |
| **[v7](v7.asm)** | **50 bytes** |

You can assemble each version by leaving the corresponding line uncommented in the `vccc2022.asm` file.
